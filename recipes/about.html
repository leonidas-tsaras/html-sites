                    <h2>Our History</h2>
                    <p>Food & Wine got its start in 1978. After a seven-year search for investors, the original group of five founders — Robert and Lindy Kenyon, Peter Jones, Ariane Batterberry, and her husband, Michael — convinced publisher Hugh Hefner to print the preview issue of The International Review of Food & Wine (the name was shortened in 1981) as a special 18-page insert in the March 1978 issue of Playboy. The first contributors included George Plimpton, James Beard, Gael Greene, and Jacques Pépin, "personal chef to three French Presidents," who shared a "towering, golden-roofed, steamily fragrant" soufflé.</p>
